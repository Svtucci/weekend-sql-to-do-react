# To Do List


## Description

Duration: 2.5 weeks 

This is my weekend project of creating a To Do List. The objective was to create an app that would track a list of things to do. You would be able to add to the list, delete certain tasks from the list, and/or mark certain tasks complete. The app will also be styled in CSS. 

This project is also the first during the bootcamp to be considered a fullstack app as before we only did bits and pieces of the front and backend. 

The main issues I faced along the way during creating this was implementing React as we had just learned it, I leaned heavily into my instructors office hours and communication channels to get extra help. The CSS styling I left for the end leaves alot to be desired but I have not done much in CSS and need more practice on it. 

## Built With

1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. React
4. PostgreSQL
